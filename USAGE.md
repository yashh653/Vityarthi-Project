2. Record grades throughout semester (Option 4 → 1)
3. Generate transcripts (Option 4 → 3)
4. Export final reports (Option 5 → 5)

### Workflow 3: Semester End Reports
1. View top students (Option 6 → 2)
2. Check GPA distribution (Option 6 → 1)
3. Export all data (Options 5 → 3, 4, 5)
4. Create final backup (Option 7 → 1)

## Advanced Features

### Enabling Assertions
Run with `-ea` flag to enable assertions:
```bash
java -ea -cp bin edu.ccrm.CCRM
```

This enables validation checks like:
- GPA bounds (0.0 - 10.0)
- Credit limits (1-6 per course)
- Data integrity validations

### Search Capabilities
The search functionality supports:
- **Student Search**: By name, ID, or registration number
- **Course Search**: By title, code, instructor, or department
- **Case-insensitive matching**
- **Partial string matching**

### File Structure After Use
```
java project/
├── data/
│   ├── exported_students.csv
│   ├── exported_courses.csv
│   └── enrollments_report.csv
├── backups/
│   ├── backup_2024-01-15_14-30-22/
│   └── backup_2024-01-15_16-45-10/
└── test-data/
    ├── sample_students.csv
    └── sample_courses.csv
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Course code format invalid"
**Solution**: Use format like CS101, MATH201 (2-4 letters + 3-4 digits)

**Issue**: "Student already enrolled"
**Solution**: Check current enrollments before attempting enrollment

**Issue**: "File not found" during import
**Solution**: Ensure CSV files are in the `data/` directory

**Issue**: "GPA calculation error"
**Solution**: Ensure student has recorded grades for enrolled courses

### Performance Notes

- Use streams for large data operations
- Backup operations use recursive file processing
- Memory usage scales with data size
- For production use, consider database integration
